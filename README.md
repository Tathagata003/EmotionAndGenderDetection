# EmotionAndGenderDetection

This project utilizes a custom ResNet CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) deep learning model to create a gender and emotion detector. The ResNet model is built from scratch, allowing for flexibility and customization. The primary objective is to predict both gender and emotion based on facial expressions in real-time.

*Features*
* ResNet CNN Model: The project features a ResNet CNN architecture designed for gender and emotion detection.

* Training Data: The model is trained using the FER (Facial Expression Recognition) dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset includes a diverse set of facial expressions, making the model robust in recognizing different emotions.

* Model Storage: The trained ResNet model is saved in the h5 format, facilitating easy integration and deployment.
